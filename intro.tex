The subsurface continuation of exposed geology can be extrapolated and interpolated using structures delineated by a regions magnetic potential field anomaly.
For this reason, magnetic field survey grids are commonly used by geophysicists for geological mapping and interpretation.
Aircraft are used in exploration geophysics to undertake rapid and extensive surveys, with a predictable cost.


%% Airborne surveys are routinely conducted as pre-competitive regional data acquisition to stimulate exploration, or as targeted investigations by the exploration industry.
%% Surveys are also routinely collected on the ground or by satellite, with processing methods and interpretation shared between all forms of acquisition.
%% The collected data may contain millions of discrete samples scattered in three dimensions,
%% Interpretation often relies on regularisation to a quantised grid, allowing digital processing and human or machine interpretation.
Open file data from government or publicly released commercial surveys form part of the greenfields exploration.
Case studies on open file data are presented throughout to develop the method.
%% Budgets: Flying, handling, storage,

% Enhance the information extractable from potential field surveys.
% In combination they reflect ongoing advances in deep learning and,
% their extension to challenges and opportunities in geophysics.
